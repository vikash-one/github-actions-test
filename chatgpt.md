It seems like you're referring to a GitHub repository URL: `git@github.com:vikash-one/github-actions-lab.git`. This is a Git URL that you can use to clone a repository using SSH. To help you with setting up the repository and workflow for your lab, here are the steps you can follow:

### **1. Clone Your Repository**

To clone your repository, open a terminal on your local machine (or GitHub Codespaces, etc.) and run the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vikash-one/github-actions-lab.git
cd github-actions-lab
```

Make sure that you have **SSH keys** set up to connect to GitHub. If you haven't set them up yet, follow the [GitHub SSH key setup guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

### **2. Create and Add the `test_script.sh`**

If you donâ€™t already have the `test_script.sh`, create it by running the following command inside your repository folder:

```bash
touch test_script.sh
```

Open `test_script.sh` and add the content you want. Here is a simple example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Simple test script to check GitHub Actions flow

# Create a test file
echo "This is a test file created by GitHub Actions." > test_file.txt

# Log the current date and time
echo "Current Date and Time: $(date)" >> test_file.txt

# Display content of the file
cat test_file.txt
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x test_script.sh
```

### **3. Create the GitHub Actions Workflow**

Now, set up the GitHub Actions workflow by creating a `.github/workflows` folder in the root of the repository:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

Inside the `workflows` folder, create a new file `test-workflow.yml`:

```bash
touch .github/workflows/test-workflow.yml
```

Open the file and paste the following YAML configuration:

```yaml
name: Test Script Flow

on:
  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggering
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"  # Run daily at midnight UTC

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use the latest Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2  # Checkout the repository's code

      - name: Set up environment
        run: |
          # Optional environment setup
          echo "Setting up environment"

      - name: Run Test Script
        run: |
          chmod +x test_script.sh  # Make sure the script is executable
          ./test_script.sh  # Run the script

      - name: Verify Test Results
        run: |
          if [ -f "test_file.txt" ]; then
            echo "Test file created successfully."
          else
            echo "Test file creation failed."
            exit 1
          fi
```

### **4. Push Your Changes to GitHub**

Commit the changes and push them back to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add test script and GitHub Actions workflow"
git push origin main
```

### **5. Trigger GitHub Actions Workflow**

Once the changes are pushed, you can go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository. Here you will see the `Test Script Flow` workflow.

- You can manually trigger the workflow by clicking the **Run workflow** button.
- If you've set up the `cron` schedule, the workflow will also trigger automatically every day at midnight UTC.

### **6. Check the Results**

Once the workflow runs, you can check the logs in the **Actions** tab to verify:

- The script executed successfully.
- The file `test_file.txt` was created.
- The workflow completed without errors.

If everything works as expected, you have successfully set up a GitHub Actions workflow and a script.

This will set up your **GitHub Actions lab** and test the process without any additional costs, using the free-tier GitHub Actions minutes.
